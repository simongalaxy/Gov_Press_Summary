Hong Kong Customs seizes suspected counterfeit goods worth about $4.8 million (with photo)
Hong Kong Customs on January 2 seized about 7 800 suspected counterfeit goods with an estimated market value of about $4.8 million at Hong Kong International Airport (HKIA).  
  
Based on risk assessment, Customs examined two inbound air cargo consignments from Dubai, United Arab Emirates, declared as clothes and footwear, at the Customs Cargo Examination Compound at HKIA. Upon inspection, Customs officers found about 7 800 suspected counterfeit goods therein, including footwear, bags, clothing and accessories.  
  
An initial investigation revealed that the batch of suspected counterfeit goods would have been transshipped to overseas regions.  
  
Customs will continue to take stringent enforcement action against counterfeit goods and smuggling activities through risk assessment and intelligence analysis.  
  
Under the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, any person who imports or exports any goods to which a forged trademark is applied commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $500,000 and imprisonment for five years.  
  
Members of the public may report any suspected counterfeiting activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form ([eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002](https://eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en/)).

Results of monthly survey on business situation of small and medium-sized enterprises for December 2025
The Census and Statistics Department (C&SD) released today (January 13) the results of the Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) for December 2025.  
  
The current diffusion index (DI) on business receipts amongst SMEs increased from 44.5 in November 2025 in the contractionary zone to 44.9 in December 2025, whereas the one-month's ahead (i.e. January 2026) outlook DI on business receipts was 47.3. Analysed by sector, the current DIs on business receipts for some surveyed sectors rose in December 2025 as compared with previous month, particularly for the real estate (from 47.1 to 49.3) and import and export trades (from 44.7 to 46.4).  
  
The current DI on new orders for the import and export trades increased from 46.0 in November 2025 to 47.7 in December 2025, whereas the outlook DI on new orders in one month's time (i.e. January 2026) was 48.4.  
  
Commentary  
  
A Government spokesman said that business sentiment among SMEs in December 2025 broadly continued to recover. The current diffusion index on business receipts increased somewhat in December, and the index on outlook in one month's time stayed at a relatively high level. Meanwhile, the overall employment situation also indicated further improvement.  
  
Looking ahead, local business sentiment should continue to be underpinned by the continued positive momentum of the Hong Kong economy. The Government will closely monitor the uncertainties in the external environment.  
  
Further information  
  
The Monthly Survey on Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises aims to provide a quick reference, with minimum time lag, for assessing the short-term business situation faced by SMEs. SMEs covered in this survey refer to companies with fewer than 50 persons engaged. Respondents were asked to exclude seasonal fluctuations in reporting their views. Based on the views collected from the survey, a set of diffusion indices (including current and outlook diffusion indices) is compiled. A reading above 50 indicates that the business condition is generally favourable, whereas that below 50 indicates otherwise. As for statistics on the business prospects of prominent companies in Hong Kong, users may refer to the publication entitled "Report on Quarterly Business Tendency Survey" released by the C&SD.  
  
The results of the survey should be interpreted with care. The survey solicits feedback from a panel sample of about 600 SMEs each month and the survey findings are thus subject to sample size constraint. Views collected from the survey refer only to those of respondents on their own companies rather than those on the respective sectors they are engaged in. Besides, in this type of opinion survey on expected business situation, the views collected in the survey are affected by the events in the community occurring around the time of enumeration, and it is difficult to establish precisely the extent to which respondents' perception of the business situation accords with the underlying trends. For this survey, main bulk of the data were collected around the last week of the reference month.  
  
More detailed statistics are given in the "Report on Monthly Survey on the Business Situation of Small and Medium-sized Enterprises". Users can browse and download the publication at the website of the C&SD ([www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300](https://www.censtatd.gov.hk/en/EIndexbySubject.html?pcode=B1080015&scode=300)).  
  
Users who have enquiries about the survey results may contact Industrial Production Statistics Section of the C&SD (Tel: 3903 7246; email: sme-survey@censtatd.gov.hk).

Hong Kong Customs conducts interdepartmental anti-illicit cigarette publicity activities in Tai Wai (with photos) 
Hong Kong Customs today (January 13) conducted a joint anti-illicit cigarette publicity campaign with members of the Sha Tin District Council, the Tobacco and Alcohol Control Office (TACO) of the Department of Health, the Police and the Housing Department (HD) at Lung Hang Estate and Mei Lam Estate in Tai Wai and publicised the Duty Stamp System.  
  
Customs officers patrolled the housing estates and distributed promotional items, as well as explained anti-illicit cigarette messages and the new penalties for offences related to illicit cigarettes to residents, including the penalty increase for offences of failing to declare to Customs officers compoundable under the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO) from $2,000 to $5,000 and the enhanced maximum penalty for relevant offences relating to duty-not-paid tobacco from a $1 million fine and two-year imprisonment to a $2 million fine and seven-year imprisonment.   
  
Customs officers also introduced the Duty Stamp System to be implemented in Hong Kong to members of the District Council and residents. The three-month Pilot Run for the Duty Stamp System launched by Customs concluded on January 4. Customs will, upon concluding the experience gained in the Pilot Run and examining the feedback collected from various stakeholders, work with a technical consultant to optimise the design of the Duty Stamp System. Customs plans to implement the first phase of the Duty Stamp System in the fourth quarter of this year, with full implementation in the second quarter of 2027, thus achieving the ultimate goal of effectively distinguishing duty-paid cigarettes from duty-not-paid ones and combating "cheap whites".  
  
Customs will continue to strengthen publicity and education to raise the public awareness of anti-illicit cigarettes. If public rental housing units are found to be involved in illicit cigarette crimes, Customs will notify the HD for follow-up action after the conclusion of court proceedings. Customs reminds members of the public, especially young people, not to buy or sell illicit cigarettes or distribute illicit cigarette leaflets to avoid creating a criminal record that could affect their future.   
  
Under the DCO, anyone involved in dealing with, possession of, selling or buying illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years. Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form ([eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002](https://eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en/)).   
  
In accordance with the Smoking (Public Health) Ordinance (Cap. 371), no person shall distribute any smoking product advertisement (including any promotional leaflets). Any person who contravenes the regulation is liable to a maximum fine of $50,000. Members of the public may report any suspected activities of illicit cigarette leaflets distribution to TACO's hotline 2961 8823.

Care the Carers Campaign - Carer-friendly Commendation Ceremony held today (with photos)
The Social Welfare Department (SWD) held the Care the Carers Campaign - Carer-friendly Commendation Ceremony at the Hong Kong Science Park today (January 13) to commend outstanding carers as well as neighbours and employers who actively support carers, acknowledge their dedication and contributions, and appeal to all sectors of society to join hands in building a carer-friendly community.  
  
Officiated by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun; the Permanent Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Ms Alice Lau; and the Director of Social Welfare, Mr Edward To, the ceremony was attended by around 800 guests, including government officials, Legislative Council Members, District Council members, advisory committee members, representatives from non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and district organisations, as well as elderly persons, persons with disabilities and their carers, demonstrating widespread community support and concern for carers.  
  
The territory-wide publicity campaign, Care the Carers Campaign, is now in its third year. Under the theme "Fostering a Carer-friendly Community", the SWD organised a Carer-friendly Commendation Scheme, which comprises three groups - "touching carers", "carer-friendly neighbours" and "carer-friendly employers". The Scheme received over 610 submissions, reflecting an enthusiastic public response. Members of the vetting panel included representatives from government departments, NGOs, academia, the business sector, and district organisations. The list of commendations is in the Annex (Chinese version only).  
  
Mr Sun said at the ceremony that, in addition to ongoing territory-wide publicity efforts, the SWD has implemented various measures in recent years to support carers, including the sequential launch of the Information Gateway for Carers ([carers.hk](https://carers.hk/en-us)) and the 24-hour Designated Hotline for Carer Support 182 183, enabling carers to seek help at any time. The SWD also rolled out two pilot schemes last July in collaboration with the Hospital Authority and the Hong Kong Housing Authority. Through the integration, sharing and analysis of data, these initiatives strengthen cross-sectoral collaboration, identify high-risk cases more effectively and enhance support for them, thereby improving community care services for the elderly and persons with disabilities. The Government will further systematise and expand these databases, with the next phase covering high-risk households in Hong Kong Housing Society units and "three-nil" buildings.  
  
At the commendation ceremony, Mr Sun also highly praised the commended carers, neighbours, and employers. Each of their touching stories embodies compassion, responsibility, mutual assistance and support. He expressed hope that the carer-friendly culture and spirit would take root and continue to grow in the community, building a stronger foundation for carer services in the community, thereby enhancing social cohesion. Mr Sun also pointed out that technology serves as a powerful partner in caregiving, and that making good use of technology products could not only improve the quality of life for the elderly and persons with disabilities but also alleviate carers' burdens. A "Carer Technology Product Gallery" was held alongside the ceremony today, featuring various gerontechnology products suitable for home use and allowing participants to experience them firsthand.  
  
To enhance public understanding of carer support services and related resources, the SWD has produced a short video titled "Support the Carers Take a break and Move on". The short video and three other videos featuring the stories of the commended carers, neighbours, and employers have been uploaded to the SWD's YouTube channel ([www.youtube.com/@SocialWelfareDepartment](https://www.youtube.com/@SocialWelfareDepartment)).

Property owner fined over $60,000 for not complying with removal order
An owner was convicted and fined $66,040 in total, of which $56,040 was the fine for the number of days that the offence continued, at the Tuen Mun Magistrates' Courts last Friday (January 9) for failing to comply with a removal order issued under the Buildings Ordinance (BO) (Cap. 123).   
  
The case involved unauthorised building works (UBWs) with an area of about 45 square metres on the roof of a village house on a lot in D.D.130, Tuen Mun. Since the Lands Department would not issue a certificate of exemption for the UBWs and the UBWs were carried out without prior approval and consent from the Buildings Department (BD), a removal order was served on the owner under section 24(1) of the BO. Failure to comply with the removal order, the owner was prosecuted by the BD.  
  
A spokesman for the BD said today (January 13), "UBWs may lead to serious consequences. Owners must comply with removal orders without delay. The BD will continue to take enforcement action against owners who fail to comply with removal orders, including instigation of prosecution, to ensure building and public safety."  
  
Failure to comply with a removal order without reasonable excuse is a serious offence under the BO. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $200,000 and one year's imprisonment, and a further fine of up to $20,000 for each day that the offence continues.

Import of poultry meat and products from Nógrád County in Hungary suspended
The Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department announced today (January 13) that in view of a notification from the Ministry of Agriculture of Hungary about an outbreak of highly pathogenic H5N1 avian influenza in Nógrád County in Hungary, the CFS has instructed the trade to suspend the import of poultry meat and products from the area with immediate effect to protect public health in Hong Kong.  
  
A CFS spokesman said that Hong Kong has currently established a protocol with Hungary for the import of poultry meat but not for poultry eggs. According to the Census and Statistics Department, Hong Kong imported about 110 tonnes of frozen poultry meat from Hungary in the first nine months of last year.  
  
"The CFS has contacted the Hungarian authority over the issue and will closely monitor information issued by the World Organisation for Animal Health and the relevant authorities on the avian influenza outbreak. Appropriate action will be taken in response to the development of the situation," the spokesman said.

Notes exchange service and electronic lai-see for Chinese New Year
The following is issued on behalf of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority:  
  
As the Chinese New Year draws near, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) and the three note-issuing banks (The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited, Standard Chartered Bank (Hong Kong) Limited and Bank of China (Hong Kong) Limited) announced today (January 13) that new notes and good-as-new notes, i.e. used notes which are in good condition and suitable for use as lai-see, will be available for exchange at branches of the three note-issuing banks from February 3 (Tuesday) to February 16 (Monday).  
  
The HKMA encourages the public to use electronic channels including the Faster Payment System available via online or mobile banking, or other e-wallet services for giving lai-see. Giving electronic lai-see is simple and convenient, and will contribute to sustainable development by reducing the usage of physical red packets and banknotes. Major banks and electronic payment operators will encourage giving electronic lai-see by various promotional programmes. The public may refer to the details of these programmes as and when announced by banks and operators.  
  
The three note-issuing banks will put in place appropriate measures to facilitate the notes exchange, including:  

(1)  | Advancing the opening hour to 8am on the first 3 days of the service period, i.e. February 3 (Tuesday) to February 5 (Thursday), and dedicating the aforesaid additional operation hour, i.e. 8am to 9am, exclusively for providing the notes exchange service;  
---|---  
(2) | Offering online booking service for both new notes and good-as-new notes starting from January 27 (Tuesday), details of which will be announced by individual note-issuing banks within next week; and  
(3) | Putting in place crowd management measures such as distributing physical tickets and implementing queue management when needed.  
  
​Members of the public who desire to use cash for giving lai-see may wish to check for any remaining stock of new notes or good-as-new notes at home before going to a bank. Also, there is no need to rush to exchange for new notes and good-as-new notes during the first few days of the service period as banks will ensure the supply of these notes throughout the service period.

Finale and masterclass of second edition of Go! Illustrators - Hong Kong Picture Book Illustrators International Book Fairs Promotion Scheme sponsored by Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency held (with photos)
Sponsored by the Cultural and Creative Industries Development Agency under the Culture, Sports and Tourism Bureau, the finale and masterclass of the second edition of Go! Illustrators - Hong Kong Picture Book Illustrators at International Book Fairs Promotion Scheme (Go! Illustrators) was held today (January 13) to recognise the fruitful results achieved by the participating local emerging picture book illustrators.  
  
Speaking at the finale today, the Commissioner for Cultural and Creative Industries, Miss Drew Lai, remarked that the first and second editions of Go! Illustrators have nurtured a total of 16 emerging illustrators who received over 25 nominations and awards in international illustration or picture book competitions. This proved that the ability of local emerging illustrators and the quality of their creations are competitive with their international counterparts outside Hong Kong.  
  
The scheme aims to support local emerging illustrators to attend large-scale international book fairs, partake in international illustration competitions and create new silent books (picture books with no text). Organised by the Innovative Entrepreneur Association, the second edition of Go! Illustrators provided resources and mentoring for the eight selected local emerging illustrators, and sponsored them to attend the Bologna Children's Book Fair held in Italy, the Beijing International Book Fair and the China Shanghai International Children's Book Fair in 2025 to broaden their international exposure and explore external markets. The illustrators were also supported to compete in 13 international illustration or picture book competitions, and each publish a silent book with a view to enhancing their international visibility and enriching their portfolios.

Hong Kong Customs strengthens enforcement against unlicensed money services on social media platforms
In recent years, Hong Kong Customs has noted an increasing trend in cases involving unlicensed money services provided through social media platforms. To effectively combat such illegal activities, Customs has intensified online patrols and enforcement efforts, and detected 23 cases of unlicensed money service operations and arrested 24 individuals in 2025, of which 22 cases involved the use of social media platforms.  
  
During the investigation of the unlicensed money service operations, Customs discovered that in four cases, the bank accounts involved had frequent and substantial transactions of unknown sources. Upon detailed investigations, Customs arrested four bank account holders suspected of using unlicensed money services to launder money. One of the bank account holders had earlier been charged with two counts of "dealing with property known or believed to represent proceeds of indictable offence" (commonly known as money laundering), and was convicted and sentenced to 54 months of imprisonment by the court.  
  
Customs will continue to step up enforcement to crack down on unlicensed money service operations. Customs reminds consumers to procure services from licensed money service operators. A register of licensees is accessible from the website of Customs' Money Service Operators Licensing System at [eservices.customs.gov.hk/MSOS/wsrh/001s1?request_locale=en](https://eservices.customs.gov.hk/MSOS/wsrh/001s1?request_locale=en).  
  
Under the Organized and Serious Crimes Ordinance, a person commits an offence if he or she deals with any property knowing or having reasonable grounds to believe that such property in whole or in part directly or indirectly represents any person's proceeds of an indictable offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $5 million and imprisonment for 14 years while the crime proceeds are also subject to confiscation.  
  
Under the Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance, a person who wishes to operate a remittance or money changing service such as operating an electronic wallet top‑up service involving currency exchange needs to first obtain a licence from the Customs and Excise Department. The maximum penalty for such operators without a valid licence upon conviction is a fine of $1 million and imprisonment for two years.  
  
Members of the public may report any suspected unlicensed money service operation to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form ([eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/](https://eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/)).

Inspection of aquatic products imported from Japan
In response to the Japanese Government's plan to discharge nuclear-contaminated water at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Station, the Director of Food and Environmental Hygiene issued a Food Safety Order which prohibits all aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds originating from the 10 metropolis/prefectures, namely Tokyo, Fukushima, Ibaraki, Miyagi, Chiba, Gunma, Tochigi, Niigata, Nagano and Saitama, from being imported into and supplied in Hong Kong.  
  
For other Japanese aquatic products, sea salt and seaweeds that are not prohibited from being imported into Hong Kong, the Centre for Food Safety (CFS) of the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department is conducting comprehensive radiological tests to verify that the radiation levels of these products do not exceed the guideline levels before they are allowed to be supplied in the market.  
  
From noon on January 12 to noon today (January 13), the CFS conducted tests on the radiological levels of 104 food samples imported from Japan, which were of the "aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt" category. No sample was found to have exceeded the safety limit. Details can be found on the CFS's thematic website titled "Control Measures on Foods Imported from Japan" ([www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html](https://www.cfs.gov.hk/english/programme/programme_rafs/programme_rafs_fc_01_30_Nuclear_Event_and_Food_Safety.html)).  
  
In parallel, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) has also tested 50 samples of local catch for radiological levels. All the samples passed the tests. Details can be found on the AFCD's website ([www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html](https://www.afcd.gov.hk/english/fisheries/Radiological_testing/Radiological_Test.html)).  
  
The Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) has also enhanced the environmental monitoring of the local waters. No anomaly has been detected so far. For details, please refer to the HKO's website ([www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html](https://www.hko.gov.hk/en/radiation/monitoring/seawater.html)).  
  
From August 24, 2023, to noon today, the CFS and the AFCD have conducted tests on the radiological levels of 196 506 samples of food imported from Japan (including 126 297 samples of aquatic and related products, seaweeds and sea salt) and 43 368 samples of local catch respectively. All the samples passed the tests.

Development Bureau imposes regulating action on contractor involved in fatal industrial incident at private development project construction site in Kai Tak
A spokesman for the Development Bureau (DEVB) said today (January 13) that the contractor involved in the fatal industrial incident that happened yesterday (January 12) at a private development project construction site in Kai Tak was on the List of Approved Suppliers of Materials and Specialist Contractors for Public Works (the List).  
  
The DEVB, being the party to procure services for public works, attaches great importance to the site safety performance of all construction sites under the purview of contractors on the List, regardless of whether the sites are public works construction sites or not. The DEVB issued a notification to the contractor concerned today to suspend it from tendering for public works contracts in the land piling category with immediate effect pursuant to the regulating regime. The contractor concerned has to conduct an independent safety audit to review its safety management system. Taking cognisance of the outcome of the independent safety audit, the contractor is required to submit an improvement action plan and implement improvement measures, with a view to demonstrating that it has an effective safety management system before the lifting of the suspension from tendering can be considered. The suspension from tendering is not only confined to tender exercises within the period of suspension from tendering, but is also applicable to tender exercises with procedures initiated but not concluded.  
  
The Labour Department is investigating this industrial incident and will handle it in accordance with the law. Subject to the investigation findings, the DEVB may impose further regulating actions on the contractor concerned later on, including extension of the period of suspension from tendering for public works contracts and even removal from the List.

Update on chikungunya fever
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health announced that, as of 5pm today (January 13), no new cases of chikungunya fever (CF) had been recorded.  
  
Latest surveillance data  
---------------------------  
  
Hong Kong has recorded a total of 82 confirmed CF cases last year. Among them, 11 were local cases, and the rest were imported cases.  
  
Since the beginning of 2025, and as of December 10, 2025, a total of 502 264 CF cases and 186 CF-related deaths have been reported in over 40 countries/territories. Cases have been reported in the Americas, Africa, Asia, and Europe. Although the northern hemisphere has entered the winter season, temperatures in subtropical and some temperate regions remain elevated due to climate change, creating favourable conditions for mosquito breeding. In addition, CF outbreaks continue to occur in many countries worldwide. The risk of imported cases persists. Members of the public should check the situation of the destinations before travelling abroad, especially when travelling to Southeast Asian countries.  
  
Government's comprehensive follow-up actions  
-----------------------------------------------------  
  
Given that some local cases of CF have visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails or the surrounding area in November last year, the trails are currently closed until further notice. Relevant government departments continue to conduct large-scale mosquito control and prevention efforts along the trails, and the CHP appeals to the public not to enter the area in order to reduce the risk of contracting CF and to avoid exposure to chemicals or interfering with the mosquito control operations. Since the confirmation on December 10, 2025, of a case involving a person who had visited the Tsing Yi Nature Trails on November 30, 2025, no further local cases have been recorded to date.  
  
The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) has been continuously conducting intensive fogging operations to eliminate adult mosquitoes along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails and the surrounding area. At suitable locations, large ultra-low volume foggers have been deployed, and a robot dog is being put on trial to enhance operational effectiveness. The FEHD has also set up new mosquito trapping devices, cleared discarded containers and garbage that could cause stagnant water, and applied larvicide oil or larvicides in areas with stagnant water that cannot be removed immediately. The FEHD has been collaborating with the Kwai Tsing District Office, the Lands Department and the Drainage Services Department to strengthen efforts in eliminating potential mosquito breeding sites along the Tsing Yi Nature Trails. Pamphlets have been distributed to hikers in the area, urging citizens to be vigilant against mosquito infestations and take personal protective measures. The FEHD has also held meetings of the interdepartmental task forces on anti-mosquito work across districts to discuss the latest developments regarding the situation and plan accordingly to co-ordinate relevant departments and stakeholders in strengthening mosquito prevention and control measures in areas under their purview.  
  
Continuously strengthening prevention and control  
---------------------------------------------------------  
  
The FEHD and relevant departments have comprehensively enhanced the mosquito control operations in Hong Kong since July last year, and this has continued. Among these, the FEHD has conducted vector investigations and targeted mosquito control operations against the imported and local cases. In light of the local case, the FEHD has immediately conducted follow-up actions, including:  

  * carrying out intensive fogging in scrubby areas within a 250-metre radius of the relevant locations to kill adult mosquitoes;
  * carrying out inspections of the locations, removing stagnant water, applying insecticides and disposing of abandoned water containers every week with a view to preventing mosquito breeding; and
  * enhancing public education efforts through organising health talks, setting up mobile education stations, and distributing publicity leaflets.

  
​The abovementioned measures will be continued. Furthermore, the Government will further enhance the mosquito control efforts in addition to the existing measures.  
  
Preventive measures to be taken by the public  
----------------------------------------------------  
  
Members of the public should use DEET-containing insect repellents or other effective active ingredients properly to prevent mosquito bites, but the following precautions should be taken when using them:  

  * read the label instructions carefully first;
  * apply right before entering an area with a risk of mosquito bites;
  * apply on exposed skin and clothing;
  * use DEET of up to 30 per cent for pregnant women and up to 10 per cent for children (for children who travel to countries or areas where mosquito-borne diseases are endemic or epidemic and where exposure is likely, those aged 2 months or above can use DEET-containing insect repellents with a DEET concentration of up to 30 per cent);
  * apply sunscreen first, then insect repellent;
  * reapply only when needed and follow the instructions; and
  * in addition to DEET, there are other insect repellents available on the market containing different active ingredients, such as IR3535 and picaridin. When using any insect repellent, the public should follow the usage instructions and precautions on the product label.

  
The FEHD also appeals to members of the public to continue to stay alert and work together to carry out mosquito prevention and control measures early, including inspecting their homes and surroundings to remove potential breeding grounds, changing water in vases and scrubbing their inner surfaces, removing water in saucers under potted plants at least once a week, and properly disposing of containers such as empty cans and lunch boxes. The FEHD also advises members of the public and property management agencies to keep drains free of blockage and level all defective ground surfaces to prevent the accumulation of water. They should also scrub all drains and surface sewers with an alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.  
  
​The public should call 1823 in case of mosquito problems, and may visit the following pages for more information: the CF page of the [CHP](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/healthtopics/content/24/6122.html) and the [Travel Health Service](https://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/english/travel_related_diseases/chikungunyafever.html), the latest [Travel Health News](https://www.travelhealth.gov.hk/english/outbreaknews/outbreaknews.html), [tips for using insect repellents](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/38927.html), and the CHP [Facebook Page](https://www.facebook.com/CentreforHealthProtection?_rdr), [Instagram Account](https://www.instagram.com/centreforhealthprotection/) and [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/c/ChpGovHkChannel), and also the [Mosquito Prevention and Control dedicated page](https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/risk-pest-mosquito.html) of the FEHD.

CE officiates at "Flagship in Motion · Connecting the World" Launch Ceremony of Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong and Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (with photos/videos)
The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong (CMHHK) and the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute (GCMTI) held the "Flagship in Motion · Connecting the World" Launch Ceremony today (January 13). The ceremony was officiated by the Chief Executive, Mr John Lee. A number of national officials, as well as over 300 guests, including representatives from the local Chinese and Western medicine sectors and Members of the Legislative Council, attended to jointly witness Hong Kong entering a new stage in the development of Chinese medicine (CM).  
  
The Minister of the National Health Commission, Mr Lei Haichao; the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Zhou Ji; the Commissioner of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Ms Yu Yanhong; the Director General of the Fifth Bureau of the Hong Kong and Macao Work Office of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office of the State Council, Mr Zhao Xudong; and the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, joined the Chief Executive in hosting the plaque-unveiling ceremony.   
  
Delivering his speech, Mr Lee said, "The official launch of CMHHK and the GCMTI initiates the building of a CM ecosystem in Hong Kong connecting academic institutions with hospitals and linking scientific research to industry. The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government is actively aligning with national strategies by fully integrating into and serving the overall national development of CM. The HKSAR Government is committed to promoting the high-quality development of CM, fully leveraging Hong Kong's unique advantages of enjoying the strong support of the motherland and being closely connected to the world under the 'one country, two systems' principle to establish Hong Kong as a bridgehead for CM to go global. I hope that the CM sector in Hong Kong will innovate from inheritance and develop through innovations, with a view to making greater contributions to the health of all mankind."  
  
Mr Lei said, "The National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine are fully promoting the role of CM in prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and innovation, talent training and more. They are also promoting the establishment of integrated centres emphasising both Chinese and Western medicine at National Medical Centers and Regional Medical Centers, strengthening the talent pool of 'Western doctors learning CM', deepening clinical collaboration between Chinese and Western medicine for major and complex diseases, and improving the service system integrating Chinese and Western medicine."  
  
Professor Lo said, "The commencement of services of the two flagship institutions for CM development in phases last month is conducive to Hong Kong's further development in areas such as CM clinical services, talent training, and testing standards. I would like to express my heartfelt gratitude to the National Health Commission and the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine for their continuous strong support for CM development in Hong Kong, as well as the support from the Hong Kong CM sector and relevant stakeholders for the development of these two projects."  
  
The Chinese Medicine Hospital of Hong Kong  
  
Located at 1 Pak Shing Kok Road in Tseung Kwan O, CMHHK occupies a site of about 42 900 square metres. CMHHK adopts a public-private partnership model, with its construction fully funded by the Government. The Government commissioned Hong Kong Baptist University (HKBU) as the contractor to set up an operator in accordance with the service deed to manage, operate, and maintain the hospital. CMHHK commenced services in phases from December 11 last year, providing outpatient and day-patient services in the first year. Upon full operation, it will provide 400 beds, and the outpatient services are expected to serve about 400 000 attendances annually. The hospital will focus on developing six specialised CM services, namely Internal Medicine in CM, External Medicine in CM, Gynaecology in CM, Paediatrics in CM, Orthopaedics and Traumatology in CM, and Acupuncture and Moxibustion in CM, as well as 12 special disease programmes covering areas such as elderly degenerative diseases, infertility, and chronic skin diseases. There is keen public demand for the hospital's services. In the first month of operation, the booking rate for subsidised general outpatient services was 100 per cent, the booking rate for subsidised specialised outpatient services exceeded 90 per cent, and the booking rate for non-subsidised outpatient services was close to 70 per cent.  
  
As the CM teaching hospital for three local universities with schools of Chinese medicine, namely HKBU, the Chinese University of Hong Kong, and the University of Hong Kong, CMHHK is dedicated to promoting CM teaching, training, and research innovation. In addition to providing comprehensive clinical training and advanced training opportunities for CM undergraduate and postgraduate students as well as in-service CM practitioners, the hospital's Clinical Trial and Research Centre will support clinical research and the development of proprietary Chinese medicines. It will give full play to its role as a "change-driver", working closely with the CM sector and stakeholders to promote CM to go global.  
  
The Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute  
  
Established by the Department of Health in March 2017, the GCMTI is dedicated to establishing internationally recognised reference standards and testing methods for Chinese medicines. It also actively promotes the popularisation of CM culture and continues to deepen exchanges and collaboration with Mainland and international organisations to strengthen the global influence and credibility of CM. The temporary facility of the GCMTI at the Hong Kong Science Park has completed numerous special projects, including various globally leading testing and identification technologies for Chinese medicines. Furthermore, the GCMTI attaches great importance to building a talent pool, gathering elite talent from multidisciplinary backgrounds to inject continuous momentum into leading the future development of Chinese medicines, and contributing to the standardisation and internationalisation of Chinese medicines.  
  
The permanent building of the GCMTI commenced operation in phases last month. The building occupies a site of about 17 200 sq m and features various important facilities, including four specialties of advanced laboratories equipped with over 3 300 pieces of laboratory equipment and information technology equipment, the Chinese Medicines Herbarium and Laboratories, which is the first of its kind in Hong Kong to provide guided tour services, as well as an International Collaboration and Training Centre. These facilities will support the GCMTI in developing more novel testing methods for Chinese medicines and, through technology transfer and local and international co-operation and exchange, promote the high-quality advancement of CM to go global. The building also features an outdoor Shennong Herbal Garden of about 700 sq m. It is the first botanical garden in Hong Kong themed on Lingnan medicinal plants, showcasing about 180 species of medicinal plants.

FSD conducts fire safety inspection and enforcement operation in Yau Tsim Mong District
​In light of the widespread public concern over building fire safety, the Fire Services Department (FSD) yesterday (January 12) carried out fire safety inspections and enforcement operations at Chuang's London Plaza and Dundas Square in Yau Tsim Mong District to eliminate potential fire hazards and ensure public safety.  
  
During the operations, the FSD deployed dedicated inspection teams to target on the fire safety conditions of the common areas and licensed premises within the buildings. The fire personnel identified multiple violations of the Fire Services (Fire Hazard Abatement) Regulation (Cap. 95F) in the common areas of various floors and in seven licensed food premises, including obstruction of means of escape, fire service installation or equipment (FSIs) not being kept in efficient working order due to defects, as well as defects in smoke stop doors. The FSD instituted one prosecution for obstruction of means of escape and issued 32 Fire Hazard Abatement Notices regarding the irregularities.  
  
Since the fire safety violations by the licensed food premises were suspected of breaching the licensing conditions, the FSD has referred the cases to the Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) for follow-up action. The FSD will continue to liaise closely with the FEHD to determine whether further enforcement actions should be taken against the licensed food premises concerned.  
  
Furthermore, as the building management companies of the buildings failed to comply with the Code of Conduct on Handling Fire Safety Work issued under the Property Management Services Ordinance (Cap. 626) and relevant best practice guidelines, including proper maintenance of smoke stop doors to keep them in good condition, the FSD has reminded the management companies concerned and referred the cases to the Property Management Services Authority for follow-up action.  
  
During the operation, the fire personnel also carried out fire prevention publicity and education to property owners, tenants and building management staff on common fire hazards and preventive measures to raise their fire safety awareness and mitigate fire risk from the source.  
  
The FSD emphasises that commercial buildings have a high density of people and thus a relatively high fire risk. Property owners, tenants and property management agents must jointly bear the responsibility for fire safety, ensuring the means of escape are unobstructed, smoke stop doors remain closed at all times, FSIs are properly maintained, and annual inspections of the FSIs are carried out as required by law.  
  
The department will continue to work with all parties to promote a fire safety culture and jointly build a safer and more resilient community through a multipronged approach, including enforcement, publicity and interdepartmental collaboration.

Speech by SCST at ceremony to welcome Luminara's inaugural arrival in Hong Kong (English only) (with photo)
Following is the speech by the Secretary for Culture, Sports and Tourism, Miss Rosanna Law, at the ceremony to welcome Luminara’s inaugural arrival in Hong Kong today (January 13):  
  
Sebastian (Vice President and General Manager, Asia Pacific, The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, Mr Sebastian Seward), Captain (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Pilots Association Limited, Captain Chin Kam Lam), Anthony (Executive Director of the Hong Kong Tourism Board, Mr Anthony Lau), distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen,  
  
I haven’t done this for a long time. I used to be in the Tourism Commission and I did a lot of inaugural ship visits. But this time, it feels very familiar although I am on board a new ship, seven months old, right? Because I see all the friends coming back. I make new friends who are extremely friendly and they feel so at home in Hong Kong. So, that's the ship because I have the office opposite of the harbour and this morning, I saw this ship, Luminara, and it was so amazing. It was so contemporary, you know that it is a nice ship just from looking on the outside of it. As Seb just said, sort of in place in Hong Kong, and Hong Kong is so in place with the ship. I thought this would be the beginning of a long and very happy partnership. Just now hearing what Seb has said, I think that really confirmed my gut reaction and intuition. So, it is with tremendous pleasure that I join you today at Ocean Terminal to welcome the inaugural arrival of Luminara to Hong Kong.  
  
First and foremost, I would like to extend our warmest welcome to the Captain, your crew, and all distinguished guests aboard. To the Ritz-Carlton, thank you for choosing Hong Kong as a key destination of your newest and most exquisite vessel. I am particularly delighted to learn that Luminara is scheduled to make six turnaround calls in our city in 2026 and of course, I am sure we can entice you to do more next year.  
  
The arrival of Luminara marks a significant milestone in Hong Kong's cruise tourism development. The debut of this ultra-luxury vessel in our harbour is a strong vote of confidence in Hong Kong's appeal as a world-class cruise hub. It also perfectly aligns with our strategy to attract high-value visitors and discerning travellers who seek not only a destination, but a premium and curated experience.   
  
We have been working tirelessly to integrate our strengths in culture, sports, mega events and ecology with tourism to elevate every visitor's experience. For those with an eye for art, look no further than the Hong Kong Museum of Art right beside this vessel - a cultural landmark in itself, housing both classic and contemporary treasures. A stone's throw away, the West Kowloon Cultural District, also where the Ritz-Carlton is located, is home to the Hong Kong Palace Museum and the M+ museum. For the true art lovers, we offer insightful curator-led tours, private collection visits and exclusive behind-the-scenes experiences.   
  
If you seek something more exhilarating, experience the thrill of our racecourses. Today, you may not be able to do that because we have races on Wednesdays and Sundays, but next time, plan your sailing in advance, our racecourses with themed parties and live music performances. Or join us, as I said before, join us at the state-of-the-art Kai Tak Sports Park, which hosts everything from signature events like the adrenaline-pumping Hong Kong Rugby Sevens. To concerts by global icons - know that BLACKPINK, for instance, will be here next weekend and you may just like to come visit us again.   
  
For those in pursuit of serenity, our city's islands, bays and hidden gems offer tranquil escapes. Hong Kong is beautifully accessible by water - sailing by yacht or vessels along our stunning coastline is always an option. This is just a glimpse of what Hong Kong offers, and I am sure there is something here for everyone.  
  
Ladies and gentlemen, we gather at a time of dynamic transformation of Hong Kong's tourism landscape. In 2025, we welcomed 49.9 million visitors worldwide, make it 50 million - a 12 per cent year-on-year increase. While we are grateful for this affection, we will not rest here. In the coming year, we will continue to enrich our offerings, host more exciting events, and collaborate with industry partners to curate diverse, immersive experiences. I am confident that each of you - especially our guests of Luminara - will find Hong Kong truly enchanting and unforgettable: a place that lingers in your heart and beckons you to come back.   
  
I wish Luminara fair winds and following seas, and to everyone here, a prosperous and successful year ahead. I look forward to seeing this magnificent vessel grace our skyline many more times in the future, in this year and in the years to come.  
  
Thank you very much.

Hospital Authority signs Memorandum of Understanding to support community healthcare development on Mainland (with photo)
The following is issued on behalf of the Hospital Authority:  
  
The Hospital Authority (HA) today (January 13) signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the National Health Commission (NHC) and the Chow Tai Fook Medical Foundation Limited (Chow Tai Fook Medical Foundation) to launch Phase II of the New Horizon in Community Health (the Training Project) to dovetail the development of community and primary care policies and strengthen the training of more healthcare professionals on the Mainland.  
  
The MOU signing ceremony was witnessed by the Minister of the NHC, Mr Lei Haichao, and the HA Chairman, Mr Henry Fan. The five-year MOU was jointly signed by the Acting Director-General of the Office of Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan Affairs of the NHC, Mr Feng Yong; the Chairman of the Chow Tai Fook Medical Foundation, Mr Cheng Kar-Shing; and the HA Chief Executive, Dr Libby Lee.  
  
Phase II of the Training Project will last for five years, with the goal of further training more primary healthcare staff on the Mainland, enhancing their clinical practice and primary healthcare management capabilities. The project will continue to adopt the management framework established in Phase I. The NHC will oversee the recruitment of trainees and provide overall co-ordination and guidance. The Foundation will provide approximately $10 million in funding support. The HA will be responsible for organising diverse trainings, including online and offline courses, site visits and mentorships in both places, and joint academic exchange conferences.  
  
Mr Fan said, "The fruitful results of Phase I are very encouraging, and it is gratifying that we can continue with Phase II this year. The HA is honoured to continue participating in the Training Project, sharing Hong Kong's experience in family medicine training and faciliating professional exchanges between the two places to complement each other's strengths. The release of the Implementation Plan for Strengthening Primary Healthcare Services last year aims to further improve the primary healthcare system on the Mainland. The Training Project enables Hong Kong to contribute to the development of national public health."  
  
Mr Cheng said, "The Foundation is dedicated to advancing medical education and talent development. We are delighted to partner with the NHC and the HA in launching Phase II of the Training Project. We aim to benefit more primary healthcare professionals, enhancing community healthcare services by continued resource inputs and professional exchanges. This will strengthen the national primary healthcare system and promote long-term collaboration between Hong Kong and the Mainland, creating a better future for community healthcare."  
  
To dovetail with the national development of community and primary healthcare, the former Ministry of Health (now NHC), the HA and the Dr Cheng Yu Tung Foundation first signed an MOU in 2007 to collaborate on training healthcare professionals on the Mainland. Phase I of the Training Project was completed last year, successfully training over 1 500 primary healthcare professionals across 31 provinces, municipalities and regions on the Mainland. To continue the success of the project and after friendly consultation, the NHC, the Foundation and the HA will jointly launch Phase II of the project.

FEHD releases first batch of gravidtrap indexes for Aedes albopictus in January
The Food and Environmental Hygiene Department (FEHD) today (January 13) released the first batch of gravidtrap indexes and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in January, covering 20 survey areas, as follows:  

District | Survey Area | January 2026  
---|---|---  
First Phase Gravidtrap Index | First Phase Density Index  
Eastern | Chai Wan | 0.0% | N/A  
North Point and Quarry Bay | 0.0% | N/A  
Wan Chai | Tin Hau and Causeway Bay | 0.0% | N/A  
Wan Chai | 0.0% | N/A  
Islands | Tung Chung | 0.0% | N/A  
Kowloon City | Hung Hom and To Kwa Wan | 3.5% | 1.0  
Kai Tak | 0.0% | N/A  
Kwun Tong | Kwun Tong Central | 0.0% | N/A  
Yau Tong and Cha Kwo Ling | 0.0% | N/A  
Sham Shui Po | Lai Chi Kok | 0.0% | N/A  
Wong Tai Sin | Diamond Hill and Tsz Wan Shan | 0.0% | N/A  
Yau Tsim | Tsim Sha Tsui East and King's Park | 0.0% | N/A  
North | Fanling North | 0.0% | N/A  
Fanling South | 0.0% | N/A  
Sai Kung | Tseung Kwan O East | 0.0% | N/A  
Tseung Kwan O North | 0.0% | N/A  
Tseung Kwan O West | 0.0% | N/A  
Kwai Tsing | Tsing Yi South | 0.0% | N/A  
Tsuen Wan | Tsuen Wan Town | 0.0% | N/A  
Yuen Long | Tin Shui Wai | 0.0% | N/A  
  
Among the first batch of First Phase Gravidtrap Indexes covering 20 survey areas in January, all were below 10 per cent, and most of the areas recorded 0 per cent, indicating that the distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes was not extensive.  
  
The eggs of Aedes albopictus can withstand long periods of desiccation and will hatch when the temperature becomes suitable and water is present. Members of the public should continue to take mosquito control measures during winter to eliminate mosquito eggs.  
  
Public participation is crucial to the effective control of mosquito problems. The FEHD appeals to members of the public to continue to work together in strengthening personal mosquito control measures, including: 
  * tidy up their premises and check for any accumulation of water inside their premises;
  * remove all unnecessary water collections and eliminate the sources;
  * check household items (those placed in outdoor and open areas in particular), such as refuse containers, vases, air conditioner drip trays, and laundry racks to prevent stagnant water;
  * change the water in flower vases and clear the water in saucers of potted plants at least once every seven days;
  * properly cover all containers that hold water to prevent mosquitoes from accessing the water;
  * properly dispose of articles that can contain water, such as empty lunch boxes and cans; and
  * scrub drains and surface sewers with alkaline detergent at least once a week to remove any mosquito eggs.

  
Starting in August 2025, following the completion of the surveillance of individual survey areas, and once the latest gravidtrap index and the density index are available, the FEHD has been disseminating relevant information through press releases, its website and social media. It aims to allow members of the public to quickly grasp the mosquito infestation situation and strengthen mosquito control efforts, thereby reducing the risk of chikungunya fever (CF) transmission.  
  
​Following recommendations from the World Health Organization and taking into account the local situation in Hong Kong, the FEHD sets up gravidtraps in districts where mosquito-borne diseases have been recorded in the past, as well as in densely populated places such as housing estates, hospitals and schools to monitor the breeding and distribution of Aedes albopictus mosquitoes, which can transmit CF and dengue fever (DF). After reviewing the present DF and CF vector surveillance programme, the FEHD has expanded the coverage for monitoring Aedes albopictus mosquitoes starting from 2026. The number of survey areas set up in the community has been revised to 62, with some survey areas renamed. Additional gravidtraps will also be set up at different locations across the territory to strengthen the monitoring of the breeding of mosquitoes. Under the present surveillance mechanism, the FEHD has set up gravidtraps in survey areas of the community, with a surveillance period of two weeks. During the surveillance period, the FEHD will collect the gravidtraps once a week. After the first week of surveillance, the FEHD will immediately examine the glue boards inside the retrieved gravidtraps for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes to compile the Gravidtrap Index (First Phase) and Density Index (First Phase). At the end of the second week of surveillance, the FEHD will instantly check the glue boards for the presence of adult Aedine mosquitoes. Data from the two weeks of surveillance will be combined to obtain the Area Gravidtrap Index and the Area Density Index. The gravidtrap and density indexes for Aedes albopictus in different survey areas, as well as information on mosquito prevention and control measures, are available on the department's webpage ([www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html#](https://www.fehd.gov.hk/english/pestcontrol/dengue_fever/Dengue_Fever_Gravidtrap_Index_Update.html)).

CE meets with Minister of National Health Commission and jointly witness signing of collaboration agreements (with photos)
The Chief Executive, Mr John Lee, met with the Minister of the National Health Commission (NHC), Mr Lei Haichao, at the Government House today (January 13) to exchange views on deepening medical and healthcare co-operation between the Mainland and Hong Kong. Together with the Director of the Liaison Office of the Central People's Government in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, Mr Zhou Ji, they also witnessed the signing of the co-operation agreement on Chinese medicine (co-operation agreement on CM) and the Framework Agreement on Collaboration between the National Cancer Center and the Health Bureau of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government (Framework Agreement).  
  
Chinese medicine (CM) is a treasure of Chinese civilisation, and the country has always attached great importance to the development of CM. The Commissioner of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine (NATCM), Ms Yu Yanhong, signed the renewed co-operation agreement on CM with the Secretary for Health, Professor Lo Chung-mau, to deepen the co-operation between the two places and foster the inheritance and innovative development of CM through concerted efforts. The agreement also aims to comprehensively advance the construction of CM highlands in the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area (GBA), further strengthen the close CM collaboration between the NATCM and the Health Bureau (HHB), and push forward the implementation of the Chinese Medicine Development Blueprint (the Blueprint) in Hong Kong. The NATCM will continue to support Hong Kong in leveraging its own strengths, and jointly promote the high-quality development of CM, thereby enabling CM to play a greater role in safeguarding human health.  
  
In his 2025 Policy Address, the Chief Executive announced the collaboration with the National Cancer Center (NCC) to consolidate Hong Kong's leading position in cancer research, prevention and control, thereby optimising services for cancer patients. The Framework Agreement signed by Professor Lo and the Director of the NCC, Dr He Jie, aims to push forward the in-depth co-operation between the HHB and the NCC in cancer prevention and treatment under the principle of complementarity and mutual benefits. The Framework Agreement will also deepen collaboration in basic cancer research, screening, early diagnosis and treatment, standardisation of diagnosis and treatment, big data, and public education outreach and other areas. The NCC and HHB will share their best practices and latest developments across different co-operation areas, plan and promote experience sharing on cancer prevention and control policy formulation as well as big data applications, with a view to enhancing the professional standard in cancer prevention and treatment for both sides.  
  
Mr Lee expressed gratitude to the country for its continuous support to Hong Kong's work in healthcare. He said, "The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) Government attaches great importance to collaborating with the NHC and the NATCM. The two agreements signed today will further strengthen mutual co-operation and advance the high-quality healthcare development in Hong Kong. The HKSAR Government deepens healthcare system reform, strengthens primary healthcare, and promotes collaboration in the GBA. The collaboration implements the policy initiatives I put forward in the 2025 Policy Address to promote CM development and establish Hong Kong as a bridgehead for the global expansion of CM, as well as continue to enhance cancer prevention, screening, diagnosis and treatment, while creating and strengthening the collaborative platform in cancer prevention and control, thereby enabling Hong Kong residents to enjoy higher quality, more efficient and more comprehensive healthcare services, as well as enhancing the health and well-being of the residents of the Mainland and Hong Kong. Hong Kong will continue to fully capitalise on its unique advantages of enjoying strong support from the motherland and being closely connected to the world to foster healthcare co-operation within the GBA, with a view to contributing to propelling the important national strategy of 'Healthy China' through concerted efforts."  
  
Professor Lo said, "The NATCM has been supporting CM development of Hong Kong over the years, including the construction of the first CM hospital in Hong Kong and the permanent premises of the Government Chinese Medicines Testing Institute, as well as the full implementation of the recommendations in the Blueprint. The NCC possesses extensive experience in cancer prevention and control to foster in-depth co-operation between Hong Kong and the Mainland in areas such as cancer prevention and screening, diagnosis and treatment, and education. I hope that the two agreements signed today can enhance the health and well-being of the people of the two places, thereby building a 'Healthy Hong Kong' for integration into the nation's strategy of 'Healthy China'."  
  
The Under Secretary for Health, Dr Cecilia Fan; the Director of Health, Dr Ronald Lam; the Chairman of the Hospital Authority (HA), Mr Henry Fan; and the Chief Executive of the HA, Dr Libby Lee, also attended the signing ceremony today.

CHP urges public to promptly receive seasonal influenza vaccination as another severe paediatric influenza infection case reported
The Centre for Health Protection (CHP) of the Department of Health (DH) today (January 13) recorded a severe paediatric influenza infection case. The CHP again reminded parents to arrange for their children to receive a free seasonal influenza vaccination (SIV) promptly. The SIV remains one of the most effective methods of preventing influenza and its complications, and can reduce the risk of serious complications or death from infection.  
  
The case involves a 6-month-old boy with good past health. He developed a fever and malaise on January 7 and was brought to a private clinic on the same day. He developed shortness of breath and decrease feeding on January 9, and was admitted to the paediatric intensive care unit of Princess Margaret Hospital for treatment on the following day. He is currently in critical condition. His respiratory specimen tested positive for influenza A (H3) virus upon laboratory testing. The clinical diagnosis is influenza A infection complicated with severe pneumonia, sepsis and shock.  
  
A preliminary investigation revealed that the boy has not yet received the 2025/26 SIV and had no travel history during the incubation period. Two of his household contacts developed mild respiratory symptoms earlier. The nasal swab sample of one of the household contacts tested positive for influenza A virus via rapid antigen test. The symptoms were mild and hospitalisation was not required.  
  
The summer influenza season which ended last week recorded 25 severe paediatric influenza cases, including three fatal cases. The affected children were aged between 6 months to 17 years old. Among them, 20 cases (80 per cent) had not received an SIV (including one case who received the 2025/26 SIV only four days before onset of illness). As it generally takes two weeks for the body to develop sufficient protection after vaccination, the case was not protected by the vaccine. Therefore, it is not counted as being vaccinated.  
  
"The summer influenza season was ended. However, influenza activity may rise again as the weather remains cold in the first quarter of this year and it cannot be ruled out that the circulating virus strains may change as the winter influenza season approaches. Therefore, I once again urge all individuals aged 6 months or older, except those with known contraindications, to act promptly if they have not yet received an SIV. This includes those who contracted influenza during the summer influenza season in order to guard against other circulating virus strains that may emerge during the upcoming winter influenza season. Furthermore, although there are some antigenic differences between the currently circulating influenza A (H3) virus strain and the virus strain contained in the vaccine, scientific research indicates that this season's influenza vaccines can still offer protection against the variant strain of subclade K, as well as the influenza A (H1) and influenza B strains included in the vaccine," the Controller of the CHP, Dr Edwin Tsui, said.  
  
"Although the influenza activity has declined to below the baseline level at the moment, outbreaks caused by influenza viruses still occurred in schools and residential care homes. For children who did not join the SIV School Outreach Programme, parents should promptly bring their children to [private doctors](https://apps.hcv.gov.hk/Public/en/SPS/Search) enrolled in the Vaccination Subsidy Scheme to receive an SIV. In addition, the SIV coverage rate for children aged 6 months to under 2 years is only about 23 per cent. Although this represents an approximate 4 percentage point increase compared to the same period last year, it is still much lower than that of other age groups. Through the Primary Healthcare Commission, the CHP has urged family doctors to assist in encouraging parents to allow their children to receive an SIV," Dr Tsui added.  
  
He also reminded members of the public that, especially for children, the elderly and those with underlying illnesses, they should seek medical advice promptly for early treatment if they present with fever and respiratory symptoms. As children with influenza can deteriorate rapidly, parents must pay close attention to their children's condition. They should go to an Accident and Emergency Department immediately if the child's condition deteriorates, for example, if they develop symptoms such as shortness of breath, wheezing, blue lips, chest pain, confusion, a persistent fever or convulsions.  
  
Separately, high-risk individuals should wear surgical masks when staying in crowded places. People with respiratory symptoms, even if mild, should wear a surgical mask and seek medical advice promptly. They should also consider whether to attend work or school.  
  
In addition to issuing timely reminders to healthcare professionals and schools based on the latest seasonal influenza development, the CHP also uploads the latest seasonal influenza information on its website weekly. Members of the public can visit the CHP's [seasonal influenza](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/features/14843.html) and [COVID-19 & Flu Express](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/resources/29/100148.html) webpages.

Remarks by SLW on new "continuous contract" requirement under Employment Ordinance and Mandatory Reporting of Child Abuse Ordinance
Following are the remarks by the Secretary for Labour and Welfare, Mr Chris Sun, after attending Care the Carers Campaign – Carer-friendly Commendation Ceremony this afternoon (January 13):  
  
Reporter: With regard to the new "468" (new "continuous contract" requirement under Employment Ordinance) employment rule, how would that better safeguard part-timers' rights and how would the government respond to those who remain exploited under the new rule, and what protection mechanisms are in place?  
  
Secretary for Labour and Welfare: The new "468" arrangement will come into force on January 18. This is going to be a very clear improvement over the existing arrangement, what we now call "418" as the existing "continuous contract" requirement under the Employment Ordinance. The major improvement is in the calculation of working hours. Under the existing "continuous contract" requirement, the major concern for quite a number of employees is that their working hours for three consecutive weeks are quite long, with very short working hours in the fourth week, and they do not meet the "continuous contract" requirement.   
  
However, once we have changed to "468", that would no longer be the case. If counting for over a period of four weeks, employees will meet the new "continuous contract" requirements if they worked for the employer concerned for 68 hours or more. The employers have to provide a full suite of privileges under the requirements of the Employment Ordinance. I think this is what we are trying to achieve. And for that change, it is achieved through a long discussion at the Labour Advisory Board, with the consensus agreement from both employee and employer members, and then we implement it through amendment to the Employment Ordinance.  
  
(Please also refer to the Chinese portion of the remarks.)

Incoming passenger convicted and jailed for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes (with photo)
An incoming passenger was sentenced to six months' imprisonment and fined $1,000 by the West Kowloon Magistrates' Courts today (January 13) for importing duty-not-paid cigarettes and failing to declare them to Customs officers, in contravention of the Dutiable Commodities Ordinance (DCO).  
  
Customs officers intercepted the incoming male passenger, aged 29, at Hong Kong International Airport yesterday (January 12), and seized 57 400 duty-not-paid cigarettes, with an estimated market value of $258,300 and a duty potential of about $190,000, from his personal baggage. The passenger was subsequently arrested.  
  
Customs welcomes the sentence. The custodial sentence has imposed a considerable deterrent effect and reflects the seriousness of the offences.  
  
Customs reminds members of the public that under the DCO, cigarettes are dutiable goods to which the DCO applies. Any person who imports, deals with, possesses, sells or buys illicit cigarettes commits an offence. The maximum penalty upon conviction is a fine of $2 million and imprisonment for seven years.  
  
Members of the public may report any suspected illicit cigarette activities to Customs' 24-hour hotline 182 8080 or its dedicated crime-reporting email account (crimereport@customs.gov.hk) or online form ([eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002](https://eform.cefs.gov.hk/form/ced002/en/)).

Health risk category for Air Quality Health Index has reached "Serious" level
The Environmental Protection Department (EPD) has recorded higher than normal pollution levels today (January 13). At 5pm, the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI) at the Tuen Mun general monitoring station reached 10+, corresponding to the "Serious" health risk category.  
  
Winds are weak over Hong Kong today, which is unfavourable for pollutant dispersion. The intense sunshine enhances photochemical smog activity, leading to the rapid formation of ozone and fine particulates in the Pearl River Delta region. The high ozone level also promotes the formation of nitrogen dioxide.  
  
According to the Hong Kong Observatory, a moderate easterly airstream is expected to affect the coast of Guangdong gradually tomorrow. It is expected that pollution levels will remain higher than normal until then.  
  
With a health risk category in the "Very High" range or above, children, the elderly and persons with existing heart or respiratory illnesses are advised to reduce physical exertion and outdoor activities to a minimum or avoid such activities. The general public is advised to reduce, or reduce to a minimum, outdoor physical exertion, and to reduce time outdoors, especially in areas with heavy traffic. As health effects of air pollutants may vary for individuals, persons who are in doubt or experience discomfort should seek advice from healthcare professionals. The public may visit the Centre for Health Protection's website ([www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/9/460/3557.html](https://www.chp.gov.hk/en/content/9/460/3557.html)) for more information on health effects of air pollution and relevant health advice.  
  
The Education Bureau (EDB) urges all schools to visit the EDB website for appropriate measures to safeguard students' health and take note of changes in the index. The relevant hyperlink is as follows: [www.edb.gov.hk/en/sch-admin/admin/about-activities/sch-activities-guidelines/index.html](https://www.edb.gov.hk/en/sch-admin/admin/about-activities/sch-activities-guidelines/index.html).  
  
When the AQHI is at the "Very High" level, employers of outdoor workers performing heavy manual work are advised to assess the risk of outdoor work and take appropriate preventive measures to protect the health of their employees, such as reducing outdoor physical exertion and the time of their stay outdoors, especially in areas with heavy traffic. At the "Serious" level, employers of all outdoor workers are advised to assess the risk of outdoor work and take appropriate preventive measures to protect the health of their employees.  
  
Members of the public can check the current AQHI readings at the EPD's website ([www.aqhi.gov.hk/en.html](https://www.aqhi.gov.hk/en.html)) or by calling the hotline 2827 8541.

AFCD takes stringent actions on FarmFest stalls suspected of selling non-self-produced agricultural products
Regarding the suspected sale of non-self-produced agricultural products by individual farm stalls during FarmFest 2026, the Agriculture, Fisheries and Conservation Department (AFCD) today (January 13) issued a stern statement emphasising that it will not tolerate any acts that deceive consumers, and will deal with any such violations seriously. The AFCD has referred case details to the Police and Hong Kong Customs, and is actively assisting law enforcement agencies in their investigations.  
  
In addition, the AFCD will disqualify the farms concerned from participating in the upcoming FarmFest, and is considering a permanent ban on non-compliant farmers from taking part in all future promotional activities organised by the AFCD. To prevent similar incidents from recurring, the AFCD is reviewing to optimise the event's contract terms, including introducing heavy penalties for breaches of contract and a compensation mechanism for claiming reputational damage. The AFCD will also require local agricultural organisations and associations to remind their members to ensure compliance in the sale of their products.  
  
The AFCD has always attached great importance to the quality and origin of local agricultural and fisheries products sold at FarmFest. All participating farmers and fishermen must pass a qualification assessment in advance, including submitting detailed information on the agricultural and fisheries products intended for sale. Prior to FarmFest, AFCD officers will conduct on-site inspections of all participating local farms to record the varieties and quantities of produce in detail, ensuring that products sold during the event are produced by the farms themselves. In this incident, AFCD officers ordered seven stalls suspected of irregularities to cease operation immediately on the second day of the event (January 10), and took action against another stall suspected of irregularities on the last day (January 11).  
  
The AFCD reiterates zero-tolerance attitude towards any violation of FarmFest operation contract terms. The objective of FarmFest is to promote premium local agricultural and fisheries products to the public. The AFCD will strive to uphold the reputation of the event, safeguard the interests of law-abiding local farmers and the general public, and ensure the healthy and sustainable development of the local agricultural and fisheries industry.

HKSAR Government welcomes court's decision to dismiss Chow Hang Tung's application for judicial review on clothing policy for persons in custody
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region Government welcomes the judgment handed down by the Court of First Instance of the High Court today (January 13) to dismiss Chow Hang Tung's application for judicial review on the clothing policy for persons in custody (PICs).  
  
The court judgment pointed out that the current clothing policy for PICs, including the requirement for female PICs to wear trousers in summer daytime, was formulated by the Correctional Services Department (CSD) as authorised by the Prison Rules. The Court was satisfied that the CSD had the expertise and experience in the relevant context, and that it had carefully considered various factors, taken into account of professional opinion when making the decision, as well as reviewed the policy continuously. The Court ruled that Chow Hang Tung had failed to demonstrate that the current policy constituted less favourable treatment of a particular gender. The Court pointed out that there was currently no factual evidence to support any assertion that there was widespread concern about the health effects of wearing trousers in summer. In addition, the rule was not absolute, but instead allowed individual PICs to apply for exceptional arrangements in special circumstances. At the same time, the Court also rejected Chow Hang Tung's assertion that she had requested to the CSD in July and August 2024 to wear shorts and had been refused.  
  
A spokesman for the Security Bureau said, "The ruling of the Court of First Instance confirmed that the CSD's approach is reasonable, justified and lawful. According to Rule 26 of the Prison Rules, the CSD must provide every PIC with a uniform that meets a scale imposed by the Commissioner of Correctional Services. Over the years, the CSD had appointed task groups from time to time to review the clothing arrangements of PICs. These reviews gave ample consideration to numerous factors, including the type of correctional institutions, PICs' varying daily routines and activities involved, the need for thermal, physical and psychological comfort for PICs of different genders, privacy and decency of PICs and the security, good order and discipline of the prison, so as to continuously refine clothing arrangements according to the prevailing circumstances."  
  
The spokesman stated, "Chow Hang Tung's assertion that she requested to wear shorts in summer and was rejected by the CSD is entirely inconsistent with the facts and was rejected by the Court. Besides, the current clothing policy for PICs already provides a degree of flexibility. For example, a PIC may make an application to wear other clothing on medical or non-medical grounds to the CSD, and the CSD would make appropriate arrangements having considered the actual circumstances and relevant factors."  
  
The CSD will continue to impartially implement the relevant rules of the Prison Rules in accordance with the law and commit to providing a secure, safe, humane, decent and healthy custodial environment.
